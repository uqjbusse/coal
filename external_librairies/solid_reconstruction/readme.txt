This zip file contains files that were used in the case study
for image processing seminars given by The MathWorks.

In brief, the code will take two images that were taken from
adjacent layers of a solid wooden dowel.  These images can be
realigned based on their features such that the solid is reconstructed.
This demo shows two images being realligned, but the process can be followed
for all the pairs, recreating the entire solid.  The benefit of this code is
that the realignment is done automatically.

The files here should be used as follows:

main.html is an html document that explains the code that is
  being demonstrated.
  
main.m is the m-file that runs the demo.  It is explained and
  copied in the main.html file.

dowel01.jpg and dowel02.jpg are the image files to be aligned.

The rest of m-files are helper functions for main.m

The rest of the image files are for the html document.
